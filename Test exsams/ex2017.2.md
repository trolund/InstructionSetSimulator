# Problem 4

Consider the following caches. For both, assume 4KB size, 32-bit addresses, and byte addressing:

**C1**: direct mapped with 8 word blocks and write-through policy.
**C2**: 4-way set associative with 4 word blocks, LRU replacement, and write-back policy.

For each cache:

## Question 4.1

Show how binary addresses are divided into tag, index, block offset, and byte offset.

* memory size = 4KB size = 4096 = 2^12 
* 32-bit addresses
* byte addressing

### C1

note:

        To understand the difference between byte- and word-addressable, understand that a byte is always 8 bits, while a word may differ from system to system. 
        
        Take, for example, an 8-bit system with 2 byte words. The instruction size is one word, but the bandwidth of the system is only 1/2 word. The system must be byte addressable so that it can load the instruction 1-byte at a time. It cannot be word addressable because it cannot handle a full word of data at a time. In this system, the byte offset would only be 1 bit, to choose between the first or second byte in the word. 

**Byte offset** The byte offset gives the offset of the byte within the word. word is assumed to be 32 bit (4 bytes).

Byte offset = log_2(4) = 2 bits (4 bytes)
Block offset = = log_2(8) = 3 bits (8 word blocks)
Block count = 2^12/2^3/2^2 = 2^7 = 128 blocks      # giver dermed også index
Index = 7 bits
Tag = 32 − 7 − 3 − 2 = 20 bits
