# Problem 2 


## a) Assuming that at execution time the content of register x1 = 0 (branch is taken), for EACH processor

### i. Show the timing diagram (instructions executed in each clock cycle) of the execution of the above fragment of RISC-V code.

Copy from excel

### ii. Compute the execution time of the fragment of RISC-V code.

**P1**

T_clock = 5 ns

7 cycles * 5 ns = 35 ns

**P2**

T_clock = 1 ns

16 cycles * 1 ns = 16 ns


**P3**

T_clock = 1 ns

13 cycles * 1 ns = 13 ns

### b) What is the speed-up of P3 over P1 and P2?

speed up p3 over p2 = 16/13 = 1,2307692308 

speed up p3 over p1 = 35/13 = 2,6923076923


# Problem 3

A processor has three types of instructions:


The clock rate is 3 GHz.

## a) Determine the average instruction execution time of a benchmark pro- gram that has the following instructions mix.

CPI = 3 * 0.35 + 4 * 0.4 + 5 * 0.25 = 3.90 CPI

execution time = (1/3 * 10^9) * 3.9 = 1.3 ns

## b) Determine the execution time of this program if it has 10^5 instructions.

execution time = 10^5 * 1/(3 * 10^9) * 3.9 = 0.00013 S

## c) An architecture modification introduces a Type D instruction which exe- cutes in 6 cycles. With this new instruction the total number of instructions is reduced by 10% and the instructions mix is now:

CPI = 3 * 0.35 + 4 * 0.35 + 5 * 0.25 + 6 * 0.05 = 4.00 CPI
execution time = (10^5 * 0.9) * 1/(3 * (10^9) * 4.0 = 1.2 * 10^-4 S

Adding the type D will make the the benchmark running slower.
