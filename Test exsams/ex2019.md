# Problem 1

Answer the following questions.

## Question 1.1

Why is it important that the source register addresses are always at the same position in the instruction encoding of the RISC-V instruction set?

Answer:

    All instruction is the same size.

    Keeping the instruction formats as similar as possible reduces hardware complexity.

    Similarly, the opcode and funct3 fields are the same size in all locations, and they are always in the same place.


## Question 1.2

Name the two types of locality and give one example for each when it happens.

Answer:

    *temporal locality* The locality principle stating that if a data location is referenced then it will tend to be referenced again soon.

    *spatial locality* The locality principle stating that if a data location is referenced, data locations with nearby addresses will tend to be referenced soon.

    example:

    for(int i = 0; i > arr.length; i++){
        int val = arr[i];
    }

    The variable *i* will be kept in memory do to temporal locality. since it will be be accessed each iteration in the loop. 

    when arr[i] is read the values from arr[i] to arr[n] will be loaded in to memory since the compiler will expect these values to be read next. 

## Question 1.3

When does a page fault occur?

Answer:

    *page fault* An event that occurs when an accessed page is not present in main memory.

## Question 1.4

What is the use of the Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB)?

Answer:

    *translation-lookaside buffer* (TLB) A cache that keeps track of recently used address mappings to try to avoid an access to the page table.

## Question 1.5 ??

In this â€œroofline" diagram for two Opteron processors X2 and X4, explain what happens for X2 and X4 when running a kernel with arithmetic intensity 2.0.
What modifications can be done to improve the performance of X4?

Answer:

    look at page 565.


## Question 2.1

Are there structural hazards in the 5-stage RISC-V pipeline? If so, what can you do to mitigate the issue without introducing stalling?

Answer:

    In the case where only a single memory is present there will be a *structural hazards* in a 5-stage pipeline when the *fetch* (F) and *data access* (M) is lining up. 

## Question 2.2 ??

Write RISC-V assembly code for the following fragment of C code. State if you write assembly code for the 32-bit or the 64-bit version of RISC-V (Venus and your simulator is a 32-bit RISC-V). Assume the variables are according to the RISC version either 32-bit or 64-bit long (same as the register width).

A[12] = h + A[8];

h is in x21, base address of A is in x22. The base address is where the array starts in memory.

Answer:

    32-bit version is used 

    ----------------------

    addi t0, x0, 8    // load 8
    slli t1, t0, 3    // t0 = 8*8 byte offset (place 8 times stride of 8-bit)
    add t2, t2, t1    // t2 = &A[i] (calculate address)

    ld t3, 0(t2)      // load value from A[8]
    add t4, x21, t3   // h + A[8]

    addi t5, x0, 12
    slli t6, t5, 3    // t3 = 12*8 byte offset (place 8 times stride of 8-bit)
    add t7, t7, t6    // t2 = &A[i] (calculate address)
    sd t7, 0(t4)      // A[12] = h + A[8];

## Question 2.3 ??

Consider following loop:

    LOOP:
        lw x10, 0(x13)
        lw x11, 8(x13)
        add x12, x10, x11
        subi x13, x13, 16
        bnez x12, LOOP

Assume branches are always correctly predicted (i.e., no stalls due to branches), that there are no delay slots, and that the pipeline has full forwarding support.

Show a pipeline execution diagram for the first two iterations. Mark with a circle (e.g., (E)) the pipeline stages that do not perform useful work. Branches are resolved in EX stage.

How often while the pipeline is full do we have a cycle in which all five pipeline stages are doing useful work? (Begin with the cycle when the *subi* is in the IF stage. End with the cycle when the *bnez* is in the IF stage.)
