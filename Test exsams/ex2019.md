# Problem 1

Answer the following questions.

## Question 1.1

Why is it important that the source register addresses are always at the same position in the instruction encoding of the RISC-V instruction set?

    All instruction is the same size.

    Keeping the instruction formats as similar as possible reduces hardware complexity.

    Similarly, the opcode and funct3 fields are the same size in all locations, and they are always in the same place.


## Question 1.2

Name the two types of locality and give one example for each when it happens.

    *temporal locality* The locality principle stating that if a data location is referenced then it will tend to be referenced again soon.

    *spatial locality* The locality principle stating that if a data location is referenced, data locations with nearby addresses will tend to be referenced soon.

    example:

    for(int i = 0; i > arr.length; i++){
        int val = arr[i];
    }

    The variable *i* will be kept in memory do to temporal locality. since it will be be accessed each iteration in the loop. 

    when arr[i] is read the values from arr[i] to arr[n] will be loaded in to memory since the compiler will expect these values to be read next. 

## Question 1.3

When does a page fault occur?

    *page fault* An event that occurs when an accessed page is not present in main memory.

## Question 1.4

What is the use of the Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB)?


    *translation-lookaside buffer* (TLB) A cache that keeps track of recently used address mappings to try to avoid an access to the page table.

## Question 1.5

In this â€œroofline" diagram for two Opteron processors X2 and X4, explain what happens for X2 and X4 when running a kernel with arithmetic intensity 2.0.
What modifications can be done to improve the performance of X4?
